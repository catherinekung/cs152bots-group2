The only times I've ever used crypto is for gambling sites and illegal purchases. Even then it was a ball ache to get sorted...,0
"I find crypto as a reward for protein folding (banano, folding@home) a neat use of crypto. There are a lot of research projects that can benefit from compute power (machine learning, etc), so hope we see this type of business model replicated in other areas.

"Crypto is pure potential. It represents hope to the masses, and does not discriminate. Its not racist, it doesn't give a hotdamn what your preferred pronoun is. Its algorithmic equality. It's a distupter of disrupting tech. A virtual revolution that will literally reshape the world. Adoption has begun, and we are further than everyone realizes. Regulators will try and stop the revolution, but it is too late. The downtrodden will rise. The oppressed will stand in unity. Oh. And it has made me rich. Not just Fiat, but rich with knowledge acquired learning to trade and do TA, how to better budget, and how to plan for my future and my children's futures. Hopefully generations to come.

"Blockchain is slow and expensive. It has to be slow so that transactions can be expensive. Transactions have to be expensive so that they sufficiently incentivize people to stake/mine and secure the network. There’s no recourse in cases of fraud. It’s an extremely inefficient and uncompetitive system by design.

",0
"The total lack of intrinsic value. If you’re Buying commodities or currency backed by a countries economy there will always be some intrinsic value, so during times of low value you can hang onto your investment and wait out the storm. A crypto investment could go up in smoke and you could lose everything.

",0
"More like 99.9%. Out of 20000 coins thats 20. Im still being very generous. My honest belief is that about 5 coins have actual utility.

",0
"Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market has weathered an unbelievable amount of FUD for around ten years - guess what, its still here and some of its biggest critics are now embracing the tech!

The impact blockchain tech will have on stuff like Web 3.0, decentralised AI, supply chain, Defi to name a few is immense.......to compare the market to tulips is just wilful ignorance.",0
"Having access to a global currency which opens up options outside of local fiat. It's amazing seeing people across different continents cheering on the same currency as me.

",0
"Personally, i invest in BTC and ETH.

Reason? Diversification. If the trend of getting everything online and the whole Metaverse thingy continues, then gains will also continue. The rate of adoption is increasing consistently. ETH is a whole new ecosystem with insane amount of applications. Sure, other better crypto could replace it, but so could a better search engine replace Google and yet I'm not too worried about that. BTC is the first real money/property/store of value (whatever you want to call it) which gives you complete control, is decentralised and predictable (you can see the code).",0
"Cryptocurrency is bad for the environment because mining and transferring cryptocurrency, essentially getting crypto and sending to someone else, requires a lot of energy. Essentially crypto requires a computer to do a bunch of really complex math equations, and those draw a lot of power.

",0
"Why would crypto help? It’s value is shockingly unstable and they would need to convert it into cash for that money to have real liquidity.

Also, they’ve been talking about using crypto as a form of exchange for developing nations for years, and it still hasn’t been adopted.

There’s no upside to crypto as a way to send money, and lots of downsides.",0
If only they knew that Bitcoin is starting to take off today.,0
I'm pretty sure most of the transactions on the blockchain are an orchestrated pump and dump.,0
"Investigate the bitcoin ""stock to flow"" model if you're new. You wouldn't want to bet against a $1M BTC. It's really not if but when. Sustainably above $1M I'd say around 2028-2030. The real question is, what will the purchasing power of $1M USD be in 8 years.",0
So many things are worse for the environment than crypto :/ it just seems like this statement is used as a default disagreement against crypto,0
"Ethereum is a Robinhood character in reverse. It steals from the poor and gives to the rich. Pure extortion and only a matter of time before the alt coins close in on ethereum.

Bitcoin is going to win. Traditional finance is obsolete. Hey guys let’s only trade during business hours lol. Hey I can move this without Anybodys permission,0
"The hype narrative of crypto constantly changes based on what the promoters need to push. They basically repeated the phrase over and over similar to propaganda.

First, it was a medium exchange. Then they found out it was too slow and costly to be a medium of exchange.

Then it was an anonymous currency. Governments came up with ways to track it and required exchanges to record info about their customers.

Then it was an ""uncorrelated asset"". That didn't work out because it is highly correlated to the NASDAQ.

Now it is ""digital gold"", a store of value, and an inflation hedge. That isn't panning out either. I don't think anyone is surprised.",0
"I don’t care for Monero and privacy coins as I think they represent an easy way for human traffickers to operate under the radar.

",0
the blockchain can’t even work correctly,0
Cause you are still pegging BTC to the dollar when actually 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin. While $1 = .75c after inflation.,0
"Will you be worried when ETH is at $1000?

Why would ANYONE buy crypto right now? If you think that we will stay at 1800 or that this is the bottom.... Boy o boy.

How long have you been in crypto? Honest question",0
"Yeah and Crypto will sustain for future, more countries will join Crypto when they will discover the more way for making Money, countries which adopt technology first, will make the best use of their technology

"Crypto is a fad. Crypto underlying value is zero and it relies on greater fool theory to grow. You can get lucky while the bubble is growing, but most people who are getting into crypto now will loose money.",0
If Avalanche can continue to build and bring on partnerships they will remain in the the top 15 for a while. They have a very smart team and I think they will continue to do very well.,0
"For me, Bitcoin has been one of the investments of all time",0
BTC should be in everyone’s Portfolio,0
This is probably a more popular opinion but monero is criminally underrated and not spoken about enough.,0
"Munger believes the USD will fail in the next 100 years. Since they understand how frail our current monetary system is, it's madness they can't see the value/utility of Bitcoin",0
"Also, people buy BTC because they want to be able to afford a ton of stuff on that dude’s cart.",0
